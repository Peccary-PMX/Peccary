## Population description

Here is a description of the population:

--- Pecc_insert_pop_description

## Exploratory plots

Here are some graphical exploration plots:

--- Pecc_insert_PlotExplo



### Pecc_modeling

## Methodologie generic

Parameters of the model have been estimated with NONMEM/MONOLIX. M3 methods have been used in case of BLQ. 

## Equation

Here are the equation of the model :

--- Pecc_insert_equation

### Pecc_run

Here is the final run of the model:


--- Pecc_insert_run

### Pecc_simulation


From final run, simulations have been produced, testing two differents protocols:

--- Pecc_insert_simulations

Conclusion: protocole X might be more suitable than the other
