# Peccary

Peccary is a R package made to improve pharmacometrics daily efficiency. 

## Installation 

To **install** Peccary, execute the following code

> devtools::install_github("Peccary-PMX/Peccary")

It will directly install the Peccary package and, if not installed yet, the  3 sub-packages PeccaReverse, PeccAnalysis and PeccaResult.

To **update** Peccary (to have the latest version), please in addition update each subpackage:

## How to use Peccary

Once Peccary has been installed and loaded (*"library(peccary)*"), the easiest way to use it is through its Shiny Application. To launch it please execute

> peccary_app3() 

For now, two main and complementary sources of documentation / tutorial exists regarding the Shiny Application:

1. a manual ([click here to download](https://github.com/Peccary-PMX/Peccary/releases/download/Documentation/Peccary_Documentation.html)), also foundable  in the releases folder, the Peccary sub-folder or in the GitHub repository.
2. youtube videos, especially https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d77c4v2_jcw being a good starting point for using and learning Peccary

Please asks if you want more documentation.
